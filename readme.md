# Week One Project

For this project, you will be creating a landing page for a company of your choice. (Preferably a made up company with an outrageous name and business plan).

Create the landing page from the screenshot bellow, giving the following
constraints:

* The site must use a `reset` or `normalize` stylesheet.
* The `box-sizing` should be set to `border-box` for all elements.
* The layout should be done with floats or flex-box.
* The markup should use `semantic` HTML5
* The code should use proper indentation
* Use git through the CLI and have appropriate commit messages
